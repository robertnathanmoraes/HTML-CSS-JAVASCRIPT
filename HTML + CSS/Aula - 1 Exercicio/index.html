       <div class="margem"><p class="drop-cap"> &nbsp Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents
            
            designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as 
            
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting JavaScript it forms a triad of cornrstoone tchenologies

            for th World wide Web .
            
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and 
            
            other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
            
            HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics
            
            for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements 
            
            are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as<span class="palavrapreta"> &lt;img&gt; </span> 
            and <span class="palavrapreta">&lt;input/&gt;</span>
            
            directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <span class="palavrapreta"> &lt;p&gt;..&lt;/p&gt; </span> surround and provide 
                
                information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers 
                
                do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
            
            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects
            
            the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of 
            
            content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current 
            
            maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational
            
            HTML since 1997</p>

        <div class="paragrafo">  In 1980, physicist <span class="sublinhado">Tim Berners-Lee,</span> a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped 
                
                ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989,
                
                Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee 
                
                specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, 
                
                Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint 
                
                request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal 
                
                notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and 
                
                put an encyclopedia first.<br>
                
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working 
                
                Group, which in 1995 completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be
                
                treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.
